Notifications
- What to include:
  - replying to you in comments
    - click on to view your post
  - liking your post
    - click on to view your post
  - commenting on your post
    - click on to view your post
  - accepting your friend requests
    - click on to view their profile
  - receiving friend requests
    - click on to view profile
    - option to navigate to social screen
  - it would be better if it's completely realtime, but then do NOT allow refreshing - like facebook notification feed
  - increment "count" realtime also (in notification reducer) - "count" is the number of rows with receiver_id and viewed = false

- create a table for notifications
- one out of (sender_id, post_id) HAS to equal ''
  - id primary key
  - sender_id text foreign key to users.id
    - if sender_id = '', then you know there is no specific user, post_id must NOT be ''
    - if not = '', go to view profile
  - post_id text foreign key to posts.id
    - if post_id = '', then you know that it is not post-related, sender_id must NOT be ''
    - if not = '', go to view post
  - receiver_id text foreign key to users.id
  - type text not null
    - 'reply'
    - 'like'
    - 'comment'
    - 'accept-request'
    - 'receive-request'
  - viewed boolean not null default false

- TODO: handle what to do if someone else blocks you - need to handle:
  - viewing posts
  - commenting
  - liking posts
  - liking comments
  - FOR ALL -> say user account does not exist, and then remove everything - just like when you block someone else -> invoke same action?
- don't have to worry about you blocking them, because all of their data from your screens gets removed when you block someone

- add replying to comments
- find a way to shrink the SocialScreen's SectionList by clicking on section title? - react-native-collapsible
- handle truncating text that overflows

NOTE - always take blocked users and partners hidden (only posts) into account (exclude)

NOTE - for REMOVE_FRIEND action, they might have to be handled in other reducers - CHANGE IN ViewProfileScreen - Friends Tab

NOTE - for PostReducer (all_posts), TopicsReducer (all_topics), SocialReducer (all_users) for fear of a memory leak (because once added, objects never get deleted, so it might ramp up a lot of data), have another object that maps ID -> screen_reference_count, stores the number of screens that have that data in it. If it hits 0, then delete it.

URGENT - figure out how to animate Text component height?

- FIGURE OUT HOW TO ANIMATE HEIGHT CHANGING TEXT INPUT
- utilize none_msg in ScreenReducer

Future ideas:
  - realtime comments on posts
