- add replying to comments
- find a way to shrink the SocialScreen's SectionList by clicking on section title? - react-native-collapsible
- handle truncating text that overflows

NOTE - always take blocked users and partners hidden (only posts) into account (exclude)

NOTE - for REMOVE_FRIEND action, they might have to be handled in other reducers - CHANGE IN ViewProfileScreen - Friends Tab

NOTE - for PostReducer, UserReducer, for fear of a memory leak (because once added, objects never get deleted, so it might ramp up a lot of data), have another object that maps ID -> screen_reference_count, stores the number of screens that have that data in it. If it hits 0, then delete it.

URGENT - figure out how to animate Text component height?

- FIGURE OUT HOW TO ANIMATE HEIGHT CHANGING TEXT INPUT
- utilize none_msg in ScreenReducer

Future ideas:
  - realtime comments on posts
