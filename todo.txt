- add replying to comments
- find a way to shrink the SocialScreen's SectionList by section title?

Look up HOW_TO_PAGE to find problems with paging (posts num_likes and users num_friends)

NOTE - always take blocked users and partners hidden (only posts) into account (exclude)

NOTE - for REMOVE_FRIEND action, they might have to be handled in other reducers - adjusting offset, etc. - CHANGE IN ViewProfileScreen - Friends Tab

BUG QUESTION - how to set benchmark for paging for num_likes in feed? - how to mark the start of the original sequence when offset != 0?

NOTE - for PostReducer, UserReducer, for fear of a memory leak (because once added, objects never get deleted, so it might ramp up a lot of data), have another object that maps ID -> screen_reference_count, stores the number of screens that have that data in it. If it hits 0, then delete it.

NOTE - When getting posts & comments created by deleted users:
  - before inner joining author_id, check to see if the user exists?
  - or after inner joining, check the values for undefined or not exists
  - QUESTION: what to do with post_likes and comment_likes when a user gets deleted?

URGENT - figure out how to animate Text component height?

- FIGURE OUT HOW TO ANIMATE HEIGHT CHANGING TEXT INPUT
- utilize none_msg in ScreenReducer

Future ideas:
  - realtime comments on posts
