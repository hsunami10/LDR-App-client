URGENT - figure out how to handle initial_loading and refresh loading for all different types of screens in ScreenReducer
Why? If one hangs, then you do not want the others to hang also - different loadings for all different screens
Maybe have another property in ScreenReducer - loading

- implement getting post's comments for both frontend and backend
  - get comments for post w/ database
  - when reloading ViewPostScreen, don't "replace" like FeedScreen, get limit 20 comments where comments.date_sent > latestDate
  - comments: { order - array, data - object of comment_id -> comment obj, offset - number }
- utilize none_msg in ScreenReducer

Future ideas:
  - realtime comments on posts
  -

REMEMBER:
  - NOTE: Do not need posts object or post_likes object in other reducers, find a way to clean up redux state
